# Quark Ports

Hi! These are my quark ports in Quilt using java. I'll port to kotlin eventually so it can be merged with the other quark port.

## Port list
- [ ] Management
  - [ ] Expanded Item Interactions
    - [x] Shulker box
    - [x] Lava bucket interaction (No hud)
    - [ ] Armor swap
  - [ ] Quick Armor Swapping
  - [ ] Item Sharing
  - [ ] Inventory Sorting
  - [ ] Hotbar Changer
  - [ ] Easy Transferring

## Other things to do
- APIs for item categorization (is disposable, is armor, is leggings, etc)
  - This will be needed for item sorting
